# TraceClustering_CTC

A Compound Trace Clustering Technique

1. For getting the sequential patterns we recommend the closed sequential pattern mining algorithms from http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php.
2. For improving the fitness of the inaccurately generated sub-models, use the tool HIF that can be found in https://github.com/woshixiaoguangw/Improve-Model_Fitness-HeuristicsMiner.
3. For splitting a log into two sublogs, the tool here needs the log address, the ouput address, the pattern file address, cluster number address, original PTCD of the model mined from original log, the minimum improvement on the PTCD.
